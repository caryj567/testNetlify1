    <p>The Thing was released in 1982 by director John Carpenter. The film follows
    the events of an alien encounter on an antarctic research station. In the film,
    the characters R.J. MacReady, Blair, Nauls, Palmer, Dr. Copper, Childs, Norris,
    Bennings, Clark, Fuchs, Windows and Garry must overcome distrust and paranoia
    to survive.</p>

    <p>The Thing, while receiving a poor reception initially, has since become a
    cult classic. The film features a unique monster which can perfectly mimic
    its victims. In the beginning, the viewer is never shown who the thing is
    becoming. When the characters of the movie finally become aware of what the
    thing can do, multiple members of the crew have already been infected. 
    Neither the audience nor the crew know who is a thing. As the film progresses,
    the human crew dwindles while the things continue to evade detection. In a last
    ditch attempt to kill the alien, the remaining crew destroys the research station
    , leaving only R.J. MacReady and Childs alive. MacReady is known to be human,
    whie Childs may or may not be a thing. The film ends on this cliffhanger.</p>
